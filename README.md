**'Self-taught developer on a journey of new found skills and career paths*'*

I'm a self-taught front-end developer who'd one day like to go into full-stack or just full backend development. This
Github portfolio is a place where I'll be documenting all my projects, from start to "finish" - do we really ever finish
though?
Join me on my journey of self discovery as I try to teach this old dog some new tricks.  Online portfolio will also
be available over on [my website ][https://allanbott.co.uk/]
